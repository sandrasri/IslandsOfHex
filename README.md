# IslandsOfHex

This project is based on the game Islands of Hex, a two-player game in which each player tries to create the most islands before the game ends. It was created in April 2024 as part of Northeastern Universityâ€™s CS 2510: Fundamentals of Computer Science 2.

The project features a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows two players, white and black, to place hexagon tiles on the board. The game ends when either player creates a continuous chain from left to right or from top to bottom. In either case, the player with the most islands wins the game.
